Given a conv. id, check if a given substring is present in any of the chunks associated with the conversation.
Confirm that what is reported as "chunk" and "history" actually match what is expected.
Compare the prediction from the batch model to the labeled ground truth.
Use a heat map to highlight the differences.
Use a confusion matrix to provide numerical metrics from the heat map.
For the heat map, compare (chunk conv id label) to (conv id label)
Number of UP chunks in a conversation
Number of tokens before the first UP chunk
Length of the first UP chunk should be equal to, or greater than the number of history chunks (this is the "effective sustained" length of the traveling chunk.
Are there transition frames more significant than the first transition frame? What determines such significance.
