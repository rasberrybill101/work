Given a line of csv text with the following eight fields:
1. quoted string called "frame"
2. a number called "label"
3. a number called "predicted"
4. a number called "chunkStart"
5. a number called "chunkEnd"
6. a double called "spread"
7. a double called "duration"
8. a string called "convID"
   
Here is an example csv line:
"the input chunk, which may have, commas",0,1,5,10,3.2335,400.8876,2234_6654.mp4

From each cvs line, an InputLine object is created with the following fields:
String frame 
int label
int predicted
double spread
double duration
String convID
int chunkStart
int chunkEnd
List<String> chunk
List<String> history

"chunk" and "history" are created during construction of the
InputLine object: 
Given an int k, and the frame String:
chunk is the list of the last k tokens in the frame
history is the list of all tokens prior to the chunk
for example, given the frame: "t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9", and k=3
chunk is the list "t7 t8 t9"
history is the list "t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6"

Given a list of "InputLine" objects, create a list of "Conversation" objects.
Each Conversation object consists of:
  convID // the conversation ID
  List<InputLine> inputLines // list of input lines that have convID
  List<TransitionFrame> transitionFrameBand // A list of contiguous transition frames in
conversation
  List<TransitionFrameBand> transitionFrameBands // list of TransitionFrameBands

TransitionFrame objects are created from the frame string of conversation
InputLines and have the following structure:
String text // set from the inputLine frame
int start // set from inputLine chunkStart
int end // set from inputLine chunkEnd
int length // end minus start
String type // set as described below

TransitionFrames are created as follows:
start with an empty list
for each InputLine object
  if there is a previous inputLine AND previous prediction is different from
current prediction:
    create a new transitionFrame object and set it up according to same named
field in inputLine object. To set the "type":
    if previous prediction is 0 and current prediction is 1
     set type to "UP"
    if previous prediction is 1 and current prediction is 1
     set type to "HOLD"
    if previous prediction is 1 and current prediction is 0
     set type to "DOWN"

if there is a previous inputLine AND 
begin with an empty TransitionFrameBand object
A TransitionFrameBand object is a list of TransitionFrame objects. A
TransitionFrameBand class has the following fields:
  int startChunk
  int endChunk
  int length
  String type

InputLine objects of a Conversation as follows:
TransitionFrame objects are created from the Frame objects within the
