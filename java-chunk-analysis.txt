Another example csv line (with quoted label):
"an input chunk","0",1,4.553,300.8876
From these 5 pieces of data, create an instance of the class "InputLine"
with the following fields:
String frame
int label
int predicted
double spread
double duration
List<String> tokens // list of space-separated tokens of frame
int chunkStart // to be computed
int chunkCount // to be computed

Given a list of "InputLine" objects, create a list of "Conversation" objects
Each Conversation object has the following fields:
List<InputLine> inputLines // list of input lines that belong to this
