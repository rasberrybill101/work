Given a line of csv text with the following five fields:
1. quoted string called "frame"
2. a number called "label"
3. a number called "predicted"
4. a double called "spread"
5. a double called "duration"

Here is an example csv line:
"the input chunk",0,1,3.2335,400.8876

The second number in the line may also be quoted. For example, the label here is quoted:
"an input chunk","0",1,4.553,300.8876

From these 5 pieces of data, create an instance of the class "InputLine"
with the following fields:
String text
int label
int predicted
double spread
double duration
List<String> tokens // list of space-separated tokens from the text field

Given a list of "InputLine" objects, create a list of "Conversation" objects.
Each Conversation object has 2 fields:
  List<InputLine> inputLines // list of input lines that belong to this Conversation
  List<TransitionBand> transitionBands // list of TransitionBand objects

A TransitionBand object is a list of TransitionFrame objects, where a TransitionFrame consists of:
  int startChunk
  int endChunk
  int length
