Given a line of csv text with the following 8 fields:
1. quoted string called "frame"
2. a number called "label"
3. a number called "predicted"
4. a number called "chunkStart"
5. a number called "chunkEnd"
6. a double called "spread"
7. a double called "duration"
8. a string called "convID"
   
Here is an example csv line:
"the input chunk, which may have, commas",0,1,5,10,3.2335,400.8876,2234_6654.mp4

Method createInputLine(String text) returns an InputLine object from a line of
csv text. InputLine is defined as:
String convID
String frame 
int label
int predicted
double spread
double duration
int chunkStart
int chunkEnd
List<String> chunk
List<String> history

"chunk" and "history" are created during construction of the
InputLine object: 

Method getChunk(int k, String frame) returns a List<String> representing the
chunk:
return the list of the last k tokens in the frame

Method getHistory(int k, String frame) returns all but the last k tokens in
frame
history is the list of all tokens prior to the chunk
for example, given the frame: "t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9", and k=3
chunk is the list "t7 t8 t9"
history is the list "t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6"

Given a list of "InputLine" objects, create a list of "Conversation" objects.
Each Conversation object consists of:
  convID // the conversation ID 
  List<InputLine> inputLines // list of input lines with convID 
  List<List<TransitionFrame>> transitionFrameBandList // A list that consists of lists of contiguous transition frames within a conversation

TransitionFrame objects have the following structure:
String text // inputLine "frame" 
int start // inputLine "chunkStart"
int end // inputLine "chunkEnd"
int length // end minus start
String type // created as described below

Method createTransitionFrameBandList(List<InputLine> inputLines) returns
List<List<TransitionFrame>> and is defined as follows:
initialize resultList to an empty list
initialize currenTransitionBand to null 
for each inputLine in the list of inputLines
  if there exists a previous inputLine && previous inputLine prediction == 0 &&  current inputLine prediction == 1, then:
      currentTransitionBand = new List
      currentTransitionFrame = createTransitionFrame(inputLine)
      add currentTransitionFrame to currentTransitionBand

  if currentTransitionBand != null && previous inputLine prediction == 1 &&  current inputLine prediction == 1, then:
      currentTransitionFrame = createTransitionFrame(inputLine)
      add currentTransitionFrame to currentTransitionBand

  if currentTransitionBand != null && previous inputLine prediction == 1 &&  current inputLine prediction == 0, then:
      currentTransitionFrame = createTransitionFrame(inputLine)
      add currentTransitionFrame to currentTransitionBand
      add currentTransitionBand to resultList
      currentTransitionBand = null 
return resultList

Method createTransitionFrame(InputLine previous, InputLine current) returns a TransitionFrame
object, and is defined as follows: 
    create a transitionFrame object based on the fields of current
    "type" of the transitionFrame is set as follows:
      if previous.prediction is 0 and current.prediction is 1
       set type to "UP"
      if previous.prediction is 1 and current.prediction is 1
       set type to "HOLD"
      if previous.prediction is 1 and current.prediction is 0
       set type to "DOWN"
    return transitionFrame
