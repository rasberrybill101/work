This code is doing a few things sequentially, using a Promise-based pattern. This pattern involves chaining `.then()` calls to perform multiple asynchronous operations in a specific order. The `.catch()` call at the end is used to handle any errors that occur during these operations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what this code does:

1. `fetch(apkUrl)`: This starts a network request to download the file located at `apkUrl`. `fetch()` returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object representing the response to the request. This is an asynchronous operation, so the rest of the code must be wrapped in a `.then()` call to ensure it doesn't execute until this operation is complete.

2. `.then(function(response) {...})`: This function is called once the `fetch()` operation is complete. It checks whether the network request was successful (if `response.ok` is `false`, the request failed), then returns `response.blob()`, which is another Promise that resolves to a Blob object representing the downloaded file. This is another asynchronous operation.

3. `.then(function(blob) {...})`: This function is called once the `response.blob()` operation is complete. It reads the Blob as a data URL, which is another asynchronous operation. This is handled by creating a `FileReader`, setting its `onload` event handler, and calling `reader.readAsDataURL(blob)`. The `onload` event handler is called once the read operation is complete.

4. `filesystem.writeFile(...)`: Inside the `onload` event handler, this function is called to write the downloaded file data to the local filesystem. `filesystem.writeFile()` returns a Promise that resolves once the write operation is complete. If the write operation is successful, it triggers an intent to install the APK file.

5. `.catch(function(error) {...})`: This function is called if an error is thrown at any point during the above operations. It logs the error to the console.

In summary, this code is using Promise chaining to perform a series of asynchronous operations: download a file, read it as a data URL, write it to the local filesystem, and then open the file. If an error occurs during any of these operations, it is caught and logged to the console.

 when a web application attempts to fetch resources from a different origin (a different domain, protocol, or port), the browser enforces the Same-Origin Policy, which restricts the web application from requesting resources from different origins. This is a security measure to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

This is where the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy comes in. The CORS policy allows web applications to request resources from different origins, as long as the server includes the appropriate Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers in its response.
