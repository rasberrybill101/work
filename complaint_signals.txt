Given a tab separated file "raw_data.tsv" that has the following columns (specified in the header):
conv_id
complaint_disat
segment_id
call_duration
reason_level_1
reason_level_2
plain_whisper
language_code

Each row represents a conversation that identified using "conv_id" column value.
All columns are strings, except for call_duration which is an integer.

1) Step 1 - preprocessing step - remove all spanish language rows - reject_spanish()
There is an initial pre-processing step. Any row that contains the word 'gracias' in the column 'plain_whisper' will be completely ignored and is not part of the data set. Encapsulate the functionality to reject 'gracias' as a pre-processing function called 'reject_spanish'. No rejected rows will be used during subsequent processing.

2) Step 2
For each sentence in 'plain_whisper', and for each keyed phrase in the phrase dictionary, calculate the jaccard score.

3) Step 3
For each sentence in 'plain_whisper' and for each keyed phrase, calculate the longest continuous subsequence similarity score according to the following function:

def lcs_similarity(sentence, phrase):
    return lcs(sentence.split(), phrase.split()) / max(len(sentence.split()), len(phrase.split()))
	
Step 4
Note the starting position of each sentence used in steps 2 and 3. For instance if 'plain_whisper' contains the sentences:
"the quick brown fox. I went to work today. Write a note to the manager"
then the start_position of "I went to work today" will be 2 because it is the second sentence.

Step 5
Normalize the sentence starting position by expressing it as a proportion of the number of sentences present. For instance in the example above, the sentence "I went to work today" will be position 0.667 since it is at position 2 of 3 (second sentence out of 3, or 2/3 which is 0.667)

Step 6
For all sentences with jaccard score greater than zero, and with 'complaint_disat' equal to either 'Complaint' or 'No Complaint', then return a tab separated file consisting of the following columns:
conv_id (from input file)
complaint_disat (from input file)
call_duration (from input file)
reason_level_1 (from input file)
jaccard (the jaccard score) 
lcs (longest common subsequence score)
norm_position (normalized position of sentence)
phrase (the phrase used to calculate jaccard, lcs and norm_position scores

group the data by conv_id, and order of appearance of sentences so that the lines in the output csv file are ordered by conv_id and the sentences that belong to the same conv_id appear in the order that they occurred in the input csv file.

Do all comparisons in lower case so that case sensitivity does not cause problems with string and token comparisons.
